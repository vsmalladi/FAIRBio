# FAIR Reproducibility Using LLM Agents

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance reproducibility in scientific research by applying FAIR data principles and automating code discovery and generation.

## Goals

This repository aims to use LLM agents to:

- **Apply FAIR Data Principles**: Ensure data and methods adhere to the FAIR guidelines for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.
- **Discover and Generate Code**: Identify existing code used in research papers or generate new code to replicate analyses.
- **Assess Reproducibility**: Evaluate whether the methods and data provided are sufficient to reproduce findings from the paper (e.g., figures, tables).

## FAIR Data Principles

The FAIR principles guide the management and sharing of research data:

- **Findable**: Data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. This involves using unique identifiers, rich metadata, and searchable resources.
- **Accessible**: Once found, data should be retrievable by humans and machines, ideally through open protocols and authentication when needed.
- **Interoperable**: Data should be usable across different systems and applications, using standardized formats, vocabularies, and links to other data.
- **Reusable**: Data should be reusable for future purposes, with clear licensing, provenance, and sufficient metadata to understand and replicate the context.
